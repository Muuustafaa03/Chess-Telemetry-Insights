This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

⚙️ Local Setup

1️⃣ Clone and install

bash
git clone https://github.com/Muuustafaa03/chess-telemetry-insights
cd chess-telemetry-insights
npm install

2️⃣ Set up your environment

Copy the example file and fill in your credentials:

cp env.example .env

Inside .env, set your Railway database URL (external connection string):

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/railway?sslmode=require"

3️⃣ Run migrations

npx prisma migrate dev

♟️ Uploading Your Own Chess Data 

1. Find your Chess.com username (case-insensitive).

Example: magnuscarlsen

2. Run npx ts-node scripts/ingest_chess.ts <your_username>

Example: npx ts-node scripts/ingest_chess.ts magnuscarlsen

3. The script will:
- Fetch your recent games from the Chess.com API
- Store them as telemetry events in your PostgreSQL database
- Print how many were added
- Populate your dashboard instantly on refresh
- Re-run this anytime to pull new data.

🔌 Optional: Enable AI Insights 

1. Add the following to .env:
- OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
- OPENAI_ORG="org_..."
- OPENAI_PROJECT="proj_..."

2. Use the /api/openai endpoint (already included in the project).
If not configured, the dashboard automatically uses local summaries.
